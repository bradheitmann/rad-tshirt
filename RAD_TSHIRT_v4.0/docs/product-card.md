# RAD TSHIRT v4.0 — Product Card

RAD TSHIRT v4.0 — portable QA starter kit for Node.js projects

- What it is: A one‑folder, drop‑in template that provides manifest validation, soft CI gates (tests, lint, determinism), and a lightweight enforcement engine.
- Key benefits: Fast setup, non‑coder friendly docs, sandbox option for runtime artifacts, and portable enforcement that won’t block adoption (coverage is advisory).
- Who it’s for: Engineering teams that need repeatable QA guardrails without heavy infra or external CLIs — good for product teams, PMs, and small dev shops.
- Quick action: Copy the RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0 folder into any repo and run:
  - node RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0/tools/validate_manifest.js
  - node RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0/enforcement/enforcement_engine.js

One‑line pitch: “Drop RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0 into a repo to get immediate, portable QA gates and easy, non‑technical onboarding for quality checks.”
