Heads up team â€” new QA starter kit available: RAD TSHIRT v4.0

Drop the folder `RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0` into any Node.js repo to get a portable QA kit with manifest validation, soft CI gates (tests, lint, determinism), and sandbox helpers. No extra installs required. Try:

```
node RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0/tools/validate_manifest.js
node RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0/enforcement/enforcement_engine.js
```

If you want, I can run this in a sample repo and push the evidence summary to docs/planning-session/test-results.
