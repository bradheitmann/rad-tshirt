# RAD TSHIRT v4.0 — Protocol Refresher

Use on violations or drift. Graduated to conserve context.

1) Inline reminder (~50 tokens)
- Restate role boundaries and current |C[%]{emoji}
- Provide the correct next action or delegation

2) Role refresh (~400 tokens)
- Reload role-specific kernel excerpt (tools allowed, boundaries, handoff)
- Confirm understanding in one sentence

3) Full kernel (~1k–1.5k tokens)
- Reload MINIMAL_KERNEL.json (or equivalent)
- Resume with explicit checklist of next steps

Critical violations → Immediate handoff.
