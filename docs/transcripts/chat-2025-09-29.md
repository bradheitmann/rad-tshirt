# Session Transcript — 2025-09-29

Focus: Documentation polish, metaphors (wardrobe & orchestra), PDF generation, role renaming, ASCII alignment.

## Rehydration Primer
- Roles: PM / LEAD / DEV / QA / OPS
- Metaphors: Wardrobe-of-shirts (permission switching), Orchestra (parallelism & quality control)
- Enforcement: Pre-commit gates sized S→XL (tests, lint, coverage)
- Outputs today: Updated README, orchestration guide, generated PDFs (README, orchestration guide, product-card)
- Deferred: GitHub Actions workflow (workflow permission needed)

## Key Decisions
1. Role vocabulary standardized (LEAD, DEV, QA, OPS) replacing prior names.
2. Dual metaphors retained; clarified orchestra “why it works” section (division of labor, shared score, timing, tuning).
3. ASCII diagrams refined for alignment and readability (wardrobe, delegation pyramid, orchestration view, context budget, journey).
4. Local PDF generation approach: md-to-pdf (Chromium) preferred; pandoc + wkhtmltopdf or LaTeX fallback documented.
5. CI workflow attempted; push blocked due to missing `workflow` scope—rolled back cleanly without polluting history.
6. Added product-card PDF (alias of README for one-page sharing).

## Artifacts Created / Modified
- `README.md` (presentation style + wardrobe metaphor + orchestra rationale)
- `MULTI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_MASTERY_for_RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0.md` (compressed deck format)
- `scripts/make-pdf.sh` (multi-strategy PDF generation)
- `pdfs/README.pdf`
- `pdfs/MULTI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_MASTERY_for_RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0.pdf`
- `pdfs/product-card.pdf`
- `docs/transcripts/chat-2025-09-29.md` (this file)

## Summary Timeline (Condensed)
- Renamed roles + updated metaphors.
- Restored and sharpened ASCII visuals.
- Added slide indices to both docs.
- Implemented wardrobe-of-shirts metaphor replacing single-shirt analogy.
- Expanded orchestra explanation (why it works) beyond labels.
- Built local PDFs via md-to-pdf; committed outputs.
- Attempted CI workflow → permission error → reverted.
- Added transcript capture (this file) for future rehydration.

## Open Follow-Ups
- Re-add GitHub Action once token has `workflow` scope.
- Optional: Add decision-log file for ongoing incremental entries.
- Optional: Publish release tag (e.g., `v4.0-docs-polish`).
- Optional: Add coverage badge / lint badge if CI introduced later.

## Suggested Next Tag
`rad-v4.0-docs-polish` — marks stable documentation + PDF artifact baseline.

## Minimal Rehydration Checklist
1. Read README (top-level) — confirm roles & metaphors.
2. Skim orchestration guide for lifecycle & capsule template.
3. Open PDFs if sharing externally.
4. If enabling CI: add workflow with proper permissions.
