# Session Transcript — 2025-09-29

Focus: Documentation polish, metaphors (wardrobe & orchestra), PDF generation, role renaming, ASCII alignment.

## Rehydration Primer
- Roles: PM / LEAD / DEV / QA / OPS
- Metaphors: Wardrobe-of-shirts (permission switching), Orchestra (parallelism & quality control)
- Enforcement: Pre-commit gates sized S→XL (tests, lint, coverage)
- Outputs today: Updated README, orchestration guide, generated PDFs (README, orchestration guide, product-card)
- Deferred: GitHub Actions workflow (workflow permission needed)

## Key Decisions
1. Role vocabulary standardized (LEAD, DEV, QA, OPS) replacing prior names.
2. Dual metaphors retained; clarified orchestra “why it works” section (division of labor, shared score, timing, tuning).
3. ASCII diagrams refined for alignment and readability (wardrobe, delegation pyramid, orchestration view, context budget, journey).
4. Local PDF generation approach: md-to-pdf (Chromium) preferred; pandoc + wkhtmltopdf or LaTeX fallback documented.
5. CI workflow attempted; push blocked due to missing `workflow` scope—rolled back cleanly without polluting history.
6. Added product-card PDF (alias of README for one-page sharing).

## Key Exchanges (Pivotal Turns)
1. Metaphor Shift: User rejected single-shirt metaphor → adopted wardrobe-of-shirts enabling role-permission clarity.
2. Role Renaming: Request to replace CODEX/COPILOT/FRIDAY/META → standardized to LEAD/DEV/QA/OPS across docs and visuals.
3. Orchestra Depth: Feedback that “musicians” mention was shallow → expanded rationale (division of labor, shared score, timing, tuning).
4. ASCII Quality: User flagged misalignment → iterative refinement + user manual fixes → final aligned diagrams committed.
5. PDF Strategy: Need for distributable artifacts → implemented md-to-pdf pipeline; CI attempt blocked → local artifact commit accepted.
6. Transcript Scope: Clarified difference between summary vs full log → user opted for curated summary + key exchanges (this section).

## Artifacts Created / Modified
- `README.md` (presentation style + wardrobe metaphor + orchestra rationale)
- `MULTI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_MASTERY_for_RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0.md` (compressed deck format)
- `scripts/make-pdf.sh` (multi-strategy PDF generation)
- `pdfs/README.pdf`
- `pdfs/MULTI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_MASTERY_for_RAD_TSHIRT_v4.0.pdf`
- `pdfs/product-card.pdf`
- `docs/transcripts/chat-2025-09-29.md` (this file)

## Summary Timeline (Condensed)
- Renamed roles + updated metaphors.
- Restored and sharpened ASCII visuals.
- Added slide indices to both docs.
- Implemented wardrobe-of-shirts metaphor replacing single-shirt analogy.
- Expanded orchestra explanation (why it works) beyond labels.
- Built local PDFs via md-to-pdf; committed outputs.
- Attempted CI workflow → permission error → reverted.
- Added transcript capture (this file) for future rehydration.

## Open Follow-Ups
- Re-add GitHub Action once token has `workflow` scope.
- Optional: Add decision-log file for ongoing incremental entries.
- Optional: Publish release tag (e.g., `v4.0-docs-polish`).
- Optional: Add coverage badge / lint badge if CI introduced later.

## Suggested Next Tag
`rad-v4.0-docs-polish` — marks stable documentation + PDF artifact baseline.

## Minimal Rehydration Checklist
1. Read README (top-level) — confirm roles & metaphors.
2. Skim orchestration guide for lifecycle & capsule template.
3. Open PDFs if sharing externally.
4. If enabling CI: add workflow with proper permissions.
